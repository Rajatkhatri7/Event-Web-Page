# Meetup Organising Web App

## Introduction
We all know that while organining a event we have lot of work to do and to server our audience better we can use the technology in a better way.
Here comes this web app which takes the RSVP of the attendees who want to be the  part of the event. Here they can send messages and response that
they are coming to the event or not.

## Technology Stack
The whole code is written on onine ide [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) which provides visualStudio code interface onlline and it easily connects to firebase so that we can deploy the app fastly.
To create the UI I am using the [material design](https://material.io/design) icons,fonts.   
To authinticare the users i am using google firebase authantication and fibase realtime NOSQL database which stores and render the user data immediately.
